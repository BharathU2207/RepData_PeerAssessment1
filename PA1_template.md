## Loading and preprocessing the data 
Unzip data to obtain a csv file 

```r
library('data.table')
```

```
## Warning: package 'data.table' was built under R version 4.3.3
```

```
## data.table 1.15.2 using 2 threads (see ?getDTthreads).  Latest news: r-datatable.com
```

```r
library(ggplot2)

fileUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
download.file(fileUrl, destfile = paste0(getwd(), '/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip'), method = "curl")
unzip("repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip",exdir = "data")
```

## Reading csv Data into Data.Table 

```r
activityDT <- data.table::fread(input = "data/activity.csv")
```

## What is the mean total number of steps taken per day 
 Calculate the total number of steps taken per day 

```r
Total_Steps <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, sum, na.rm = FALSE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(date)] 

head(Total_Steps, 10)
```

```
##           date steps
##         <IDat> <int>
##  1: 2012-10-01    NA
##  2: 2012-10-02   126
##  3: 2012-10-03 11352

Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day 

```r
ggplot(Total_Steps, aes(x = steps)) +
    geom_histogram(fill = "blue", binwidth = 1000) +
    labs(title = "Daily Steps", x = "Steps", y = "Frequency")
```

```
## Warning: Removed 8 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_bin()`).
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4](figure/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)


Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day 

```r
Total_Steps[, .(Mean_Steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE), Median_Steps = median(steps, na.rm = TRUE))]
```

```
##    Mean_Steps Median_Steps
##         <num>        <int>
## 1:   10766.19        10765
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern 
Time series plot of the 5-minute interval and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis) 

```r
IntervalDT <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(interval)] 

ggplot(IntervalDT, aes(x = interval , y = steps)) + geom_line(color="blue", size=1) + labs(title = "Avg. Daily Steps", x = "Interval", y = "Avg. Steps per day")
```

```
## Warning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.
## â„¹ Please use `linewidth` instead.
## This warning is displayed once every 8 hours.
## Call `lifecycle::last_lifecycle_warnings()` to see where this warning was generated.
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6](figure/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)

Which 5-minute interval on average across all days in the dataset contains the maximum number of steps?


```r
IntervalDT[steps == max(steps), .(max_interval = interval)]
```

```
##    max_interval
##           <int>
## 1:          835
```

## Imputting missing values 
Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows and NAs) 

```r
activityDT[is.na(steps), .N ]
```

```
## [1] 2304
```
Fill the missing values. You can do this by using the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc. 

```r
# Filling in missing values with median of dataset. 
activityDT[is.na(steps), "steps"] <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, median, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps")]
```
Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset with the missing data filled in 

```r
data.table::fwrite(x = activityDT, file = "data/tidyData.csv", quote = FALSE)
```
Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and calculate and report the mean, median, total number of steps taken per day. 

```r
# total number of steps taken per day
Total_Steps <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, sum)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(date)] 

# mean and median total number of steps taken per day
Total_Steps[, .(Mean_Steps = mean(steps), Median_Steps = median(steps))]
```

```
##    Mean_Steps Median_Steps
##         <num>        <int>
## 1:    9354.23        10395
```

Plot 

```r
ggplot(Total_Steps, aes(x = steps)) + geom_histogram(fill = "blue", binwidth = 1000) + labs(title = "Daily Steps", x = "Steps", y = "Frequency")
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends? 
Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or a weekend. 

```r
# Just recreating activityDT from scratch then making the new factor variable. (No need to, just want to be clear on what the entire process is.) 
activityDT <- data.table::fread(input = "data/activity.csv")
activityDT[, date := as.POSIXct(date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")]
activityDT[, `Day of Week`:= weekdays(x = date)]
activityDT[grepl(pattern = "Monday|Tuesday|Wednesday|Thursday|Friday", x = `Day of Week`), "weekday or weekend"] <- "weekday"
activityDT[grepl(pattern = "Saturday|Sunday", x = `Day of Week`), "weekday or weekend"] <- "weekend"
activityDT[, `weekday or weekend` := as.factor(`weekday or weekend`)]
head(activityDT, 10)
```

```
##     steps       date interval Day of Week weekday or weekend
##     <int>     <POSc>    <int>      <char>             <fctr>
##  1:    NA 2012-10-01        0      Monday            weekday
##  2:    NA 2012-10-01        5      Monday            weekday
##  3:    NA 2012-10-01       10      Monday            weekday
##  4:    NA 2012-10-01       15      Monday            weekday
##  5:    NA 2012-10-01       20      Monday            weekday
##  6:    NA 2012-10-01       25      Monday            weekday
##  7:    NA 2012-10-01       30      Monday            weekday
##  8:    NA 2012-10-01       35      Monday            weekday
##  9:    NA 2012-10-01       40      Monday            weekday
## 10:    NA 2012-10-01       45      Monday            weekday
```

Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = '1') of all the 5 minute interval (x- axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data

```r
activityDT[is.na(steps), "steps"] <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, median, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps")]
IntervalDT <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(interval, `weekday or weekend`)] 

ggplot(IntervalDT , aes(x = interval , y = steps, color=`weekday or weekend`)) + geom_line() + labs(title = "Avg. Daily Steps by Weektype", x = "Interval", y = "No. of Steps") + facet_wrap(~`weekday or weekend` , ncol = 1, nrow=2)
```
